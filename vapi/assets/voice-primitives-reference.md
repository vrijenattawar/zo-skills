# Voice Primitives Reference — Zo 101 Briefing

Primitives injected into `zo-101-briefing.md` v2.0 and where they appear.

## Injected Primitives

### 1. "isn't X... it's Y" (syntactic_pattern)
**Location:** Multiple — "Zo isn't a chatbot. It's a personal AI computer." / "isn't a feature — it's a new category" / "That's not an incremental improvement. It's a different product entirely."
**Usage:** Core structural rhythm for the briefing. Creates contrast between what people expect and what Zo actually is. Use sparingly — 2-3 times per briefing max.

### 2. "huge gap between great and good enough" (conceptual_frame)
**Location:** Investor section — "The gap between great and good enough is huge."
**Usage:** Frames Zo as categorically different, not incrementally better. Works well when distinguishing Zo from chat-based AI.

### 3. "supplant the resume" / "10x richer" (analogy)
**Location:** Who V Is section — "replaces the resume with something 10x richer"
**Usage:** Describes <YOUR_PRODUCT>'s value prop. Keep specific to V's background section.

### 4. "evaluating for qualities rather than keywords" (conceptual_frame)
**Location:** Not directly injected — influences tone throughout. The briefing evaluates Zo by what it enables, not feature lists.
**Usage:** Philosophical underpinning. When updating FAQ answers, describe outcomes and capabilities, not specs.

### 5. "spoiler alert y'all: it's not" (rhetorical_device)
**Location:** Not directly injected — tone too informal for investor briefing context. Reserved for X/social.
**Usage:** Save for social media or casual follow-ups. Too punchy for a knowledge base Frank reads semi-verbatim.

## Usage Guidance for Future Updates

- **Max 3-4 primitives per briefing version.** More than that and it stops sounding natural.
- **"isn't X... it's Y" is the anchor pattern.** It matches Frank's spoken cadence perfectly.
- **Conceptual frames work as section openers.** Drop them in the first sentence of a section.
- **Analogies work in FAQ answers.** "It's the difference between renting a hotel room and owning a house" — helps Frank explain complex ideas conversationally.
- **Don't force it.** If a primitive doesn't fit, skip it. Authenticity > coverage.
