# STYLE NOTES

style_notes: |
  Minimal, sophisticated aesthetic that relies on typography and spacing
  rather than color or ornamental elements. Key characteristics:
  
  - Typography-driven design with excellent hierarchy
  - Subtle shadows only (shadow-sm, shadow-md max)
  - No gradients — solid colors throughout
  - Generous whitespace between sections
  - Icons from Lucide with stroke-width 1.5
  - Button style: solid fill with subtle hover states
  - Links: underline on hover, not color changes
  - Overall density: spacious but not wastefully empty
  - Content arrangement: centered layouts with clear focal points
  - Border treatment: subtle rounded corners (4px)
  - Animation: minimal, smooth transitions only
  
  The aesthetic conveys: "We are serious about our product and 
  our customers. We don't need flashy design to prove our worth."
  
  Think Linear's clarity, Vercel's technical confidence, and 
  Stripe's business maturity rolled into one template.
