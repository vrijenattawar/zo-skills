# STYLE NOTES

style_notes: |
  Warm, professional aesthetic that balances credibility with approachability.
  Key characteristics:
  
  **Color philosophy:**
  - Stone palette creates warmth without feeling dated
  - Amber accent adds energy and draws attention to key elements
  - White surfaces for cards create visual hierarchy against stone background
  - Avoid pure black (#000) - use stone-900 instead
  
  **Typography treatment:**
  - Tight tracking on headlines (-0.025em via tracking-tight)
  - Relaxed line-height on body text (leading-relaxed)
  - Headlines are semibold (600), never bold
  - Secondary text uses stone-600, never pure gray
  
  **Card and container patterns:**
  - Cards have subtle borders (border-stone-200)
  - Hover states darken borders slightly (hover:border-stone-300)
  - No drop shadows on cards - borders create definition
  - Padding is generous (p-8 on service cards)
  
  **Icon treatment:**
  - Icons use amber-600 color for warmth
  - Size w-8 h-8 for feature cards
  - Lucide icons with default stroke width
  
  **Button styles:**
  - Primary: bg-stone-900, white text, rounded-md
  - Hover: bg-stone-800 (slightly lighter)
  - Include ArrowRight icon for primary CTAs
  - Secondary/link: text only with hover state
  
  **Badge pattern (hero):**
  - Pill-shaped with bg-amber-100
  - Small dot indicator (w-2 h-2 rounded-full)
  - Text in amber-800
  
  **Spacing philosophy:**
  - Generous vertical padding on sections (py-24)
  - Consistent horizontal padding (px-6)
  - Gap-6 between cards in grids
  - Gap-4 between buttons in button groups
  
  **Process/timeline section:**
  - Week markers in amber-600, small and semibold
  - Three-column grid on desktop
  - Each step: marker → title → description
  
  **Overall emotional tone:**
  Professional but not cold. The warm colors and generous spacing suggest
  a firm that takes its time and cares about quality. The restraint in
  design implies confidence - they don't need flashy visuals to prove
  their worth. Suitable for consulting, agencies, professional services
  where trust and expertise matter more than excitement.
