# TEMPLATE METADATA
# Basic information about the template

name: template-slug  # REQUIRED: lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., "clean-saas", "bold-agency")
description: |  # REQUIRED: Multi-line description
  What this template is good for and when to use it.
  Be specific about the target audience, use case, and aesthetic.
  Examples:
  - "Clean, professional SaaS landing pages with subtle shadows and ample whitespace"
  - "Bold, vibrant agency portfolio with large typography and dynamic layouts"

source: |  # REQUIRED: Attribution and context
  URL of the original page this template was derived from, or description of inspiration.
  Examples:
  - "https://example.com/inspiration-page"
  - "Inspired by modern fintech apps, synthesized from Stripe, Plaid, and Mercury"

created: YYYY-MM-DD  # REQUIRED: Creation date in ISO format

---
# COLOR PALETTE
# All colors are REQUIRED. Use hex values (#000000 format).
# This palette should work harmoniously across all sections.

palette:
  primary: "#hex"      # Main brand color - used for primary CTAs, headers, key elements
  secondary: "#hex"    # Supporting color - used for secondary elements, subtle highlights  
  accent: "#hex"       # Accent color - used for highlights, CTAs, interactive elements
  background: "#hex"   # Page background - usually white (#ffffff) or dark (#0a0a0a)
  surface: "#hex"      # Card/section backgrounds - slightly different from background
  text: "#hex"         # Primary text color - high contrast with background
  text_muted: "#hex"   # Secondary text color - lower contrast for supporting text

# Color Usage Guidelines:
# - Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1) between text and background colors
# - Primary should be distinctive and memorable
# - Secondary complements primary without competing
# - Accent should pop for calls-to-action
# - Surface provides subtle layering over background
