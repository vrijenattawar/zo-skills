# Frontend Design Anti-Patterns

A comprehensive catalog of common AI design clichés and how to avoid them. This reference helps ensure your designs feel intentional and human-crafted, not algorithmically generated.

## Color Anti-Patterns

### Purple-to-Blue Gradients
**What it looks like:** Linear gradients from #8B5CF6 to #3B82F6, often used as hero backgrounds or button fills.

**Why it's bad:** This is the #1 telltale sign of AI-generated design. It's become so overused it immediately signals "template" rather than custom work.

**What to do instead:** Use solid colors, subtle monochromatic gradients, or explore unexpected color combinations. If you need gradients, try analogous colors or add more stops for complexity.

### Overly Saturated Neon Accents
**What it looks like:** Bright cyan (#00FFFF), electric green (#00FF00), or hot pink (#FF1493) used for highlights or CTAs.

**Why it's bad:** These colors are harsh on the eyes and feel dated. They often clash with the rest of the palette.

**What to do instead:** Use muted, sophisticated accent colors. Think jewel tones or earthy brights that complement your primary palette.

### Too Many Colors
**What it looks like:** Designs using 5+ distinct colors without clear hierarchy or relationship.

**Why it's bad:** Creates visual chaos and lacks cohesion. Suggests indecision rather than intentional choice.

**What to do instead:** Limit to 3-4 colors maximum. Use variations (tints/shades) of your core colors rather than introducing new hues.

### Generic "Tech" Palettes
**What it looks like:** Blue (#2563EB) + gray (#6B7280) + white combinations, identical to every SaaS product.

**Why it's bad:** Zero personality or differentiation. Looks like every other tech company.

**What to do instead:** Find inspiration outside tech. Consider brand personality first, then choose colors that reflect it.

### Gradients as a Design Crutch
**What it looks like:** Gradients everywhere—backgrounds, buttons, cards, text—without clear purpose.

**Why it's bad:** Using gradients to add "visual interest" instead of solving actual design problems. Often masks poor composition.

**What to do instead:** Use gradients sparingly and purposefully. Solid colors with good typography and spacing often work better.

## Layout Anti-Patterns

### Perfect Symmetry Everywhere
**What it looks like:** Every section perfectly centered, equal spacing on all sides, mirrored layouts without variation.

**Why it's bad:** Feels robotic and lacks the subtle imperfections that make designs feel human and dynamic.

**What to do instead:** Introduce asymmetry purposefully. Vary alignment, create tension with off-center elements, use white space strategically.

### Generic 3-Column Feature Grids
**What it looks like:** Three equal columns with icon + headline + description, perfectly aligned in rows.

**Why it's bad:** Predictable and overused. Shows up on 90% of SaaS landing pages.

**What to do instead:** Vary your feature presentation. Try asymmetrical grids, alternating layouts, or integrated feature showcases within other content.

### No Visual Hierarchy
**What it looks like:** Every element fighting for attention—similar sizing, weight, and positioning for all content.

**Why it's bad:** Users can't distinguish what's important. Creates cognitive overload and poor usability.

**What to do instead:** Create clear hierarchy with size, color, position, and spacing. Guide users through content intentionally.

### Excessive Whitespace OR Cramped Spacing
**What it looks like:** Either massive gaps between elements or everything squished together without breathing room.

**Why it's bad:** Poor spacing shows lack of design confidence. Too much looks unfinished, too little looks amateur.

**What to do instead:** Use consistent spacing systems (8px, 16px, 24px, etc.). Leave enough space for elements to breathe without feeling disconnected.

### Predictable Flow Patterns
**What it looks like:** Hero → features → testimonials → CTA, repeated identically across sites.

**Why it's bad:** Users become blind to predictable patterns. No engagement or memorability.

**What to do instead:** Vary your content flow. Interweave different content types, create narrative arcs, surprise users positively.

## Typography Anti-Patterns

### Too Many Font Families
**What it looks like:** Display font + body font + accent font + monospace font all in one design.

**Why it's bad:** Inconsistent brand voice and visual chaos. Shows lack of typographic discipline.

**What to do instead:** Stick to 1-2 font families. Use weight and size variations within the same family for hierarchy.

### Poor Contrast
**What it looks like:** Light gray text (#9CA3AF) on white backgrounds, especially for body copy.

**Why it's bad:** Accessibility nightmare. Looks washed out and unprofessional.

**What to do instead:** Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum for body text. Use true black or dark grays (#1F2937) for readability.

### No Clear Heading Hierarchy
**What it looks like:** All headings similar size, or random sizing without systematic progression.

**Why it's bad:** Breaks content organization and user scanning patterns.

**What to do instead:** Create clear type scale (e.g., 48px/36px/24px/18px) and stick to it consistently.

### Overly Stylized Display Fonts
**What it looks like:** Script fonts, decorative fonts, or ultra-condensed fonts used for body text or small UI elements.

**Why it's bad:** Sacrifices readability for style. Often inappropriate for digital interfaces.

**What to do instead:** Save decorative fonts for large headings only. Use legible sans-serifs for UI and body text.

### Inconsistent Sizing Scale
**What it looks like:** Font sizes like 17px, 23px, 31px—arbitrary numbers without system.

**Why it's bad:** Creates visual tension and suggests amateur execution.

**What to do instead:** Use modular scale (1.2x, 1.5x, 1.618x multipliers) or design system presets (14px/16px/18px/24px/32px/48px).

## Imagery Anti-Patterns

### Generic Isometric Illustrations
**What it looks like:** The "blob people" with no facial features, flat colors, and predictable poses pointing at screens.

**Why it's bad:** Completely generic and overused. Zero brand personality or authenticity.

**What to do instead:** Use photography, custom illustrations, or abstract graphics that reflect your actual brand personality.

### Stock Photos of People Pointing at Screens
**What it looks like:** Diverse groups of attractive people in business casual, enthusiastically gesturing at laptops.

**Why it's bad:** Feels fake and disconnected from reality. Everyone recognizes these as stock photos.

**What to do instead:** Real product screenshots, authentic workplace photos, or focus on the product itself.

### Overly Polished 3D Renders
**What it looks like:** Perfect geometric shapes with glossy materials and dramatic lighting.

**Why it's bad:** Feels artificial and disconnected from human experience. Often used to hide lack of real product.

**What to do instead:** Show real products, real interfaces, real people using your product.

### Abstract Gradients as Hero Backgrounds
**What it looks like:** Flowing gradient shapes or blurred geometric forms as page backgrounds.

**Why it's bad:** Generic placeholder that adds no meaning or brand value.

**What to do instead:** Use your actual product, relevant photography, or branded graphic elements with purpose.

### AI-Generated Images
**What it looks like:** Slightly "off" proportions, uncanny valley faces, or telltale AI artifacts in hands/text/details.

**Why it's bad:** Increasingly recognizable as AI-generated, which can hurt credibility and authenticity.

**What to do instead:** Invest in real photography, hire illustrators, or use high-quality stock imagery when budget allows.

## Animation Anti-Patterns

### Everything Animates on Scroll
**What it looks like:** Every element fading in, sliding up, or scaling as users scroll down the page.

**Why it's bad:** Overuse makes animations meaningless. Slows down content consumption and feels gimmicky.

**What to do instead:** Animate purposefully. Save animations for important interactions or state changes.

### Parallax Effects Everywhere
**What it looks like:** Multiple layers moving at different speeds throughout the entire page.

**Why it's bad:** Nauseating for some users, performance-heavy, often distracting from content.

**What to do instead:** Use parallax sparingly for hero sections only, or skip it entirely for better performance.

### Bouncing Elements
**What it looks like:** Buttons, icons, or sections that bounce repeatedly to grab attention.

**Why it's bad:** Annoying and unprofessional. Suggests desperation for user attention.

**What to do instead:** Use subtle hover states and smooth transitions. Let your content earn attention.

### Slow Fade-ins
**What it looks like:** Elements taking 2+ seconds to fade in, blocking users from accessing content.

**Why it's bad:** Hurts usability and feels sluggish. Users want immediate access to information.

**What to do instead:** Keep animations under 300ms for UI interactions. Make content accessible immediately.

### Animation for Animation's Sake
**What it looks like:** Decorative animations that don't enhance understanding or usability.

**Why it's bad:** Wastes development time and user attention on meaningless flourishes.

**What to do instead:** Every animation should serve a purpose—feedback, guidance, or delight at key moments.

## Copy Anti-Patterns

### "Revolutionize Your Workflow"
**What it looks like:** Generic superlatives like "revolutionary," "game-changing," "cutting-edge," or "next-generation."

**Why it's bad:** Meaningless buzzwords that every company uses. Sounds like marketing speak rather than human communication.

**What to do instead:** Be specific about actual benefits. "Save 2 hours per day" is better than "increase productivity."

### "Seamless Integration"
**What it looks like:** Tech jargon like "seamless," "robust," "scalable," "enterprise-grade," without explanation.

**Why it's bad:** Vague promises that don't tell users what they actually get.

**What to do instead:** Explain what the integration actually does and why it matters to the user.

### Buzzword Soup
**What it looks like:** "Leverage synergistic solutions to optimize your digital transformation journey."

**Why it's bad:** Incomprehensible to normal humans. Sounds like it was written by a committee of consultants.

**What to do instead:** Write like you're explaining to a friend. Use simple, clear language.

### Overly Long Hero Headlines
**What it looks like:** "The most comprehensive, AI-powered, cloud-based solution for modern teams who want to streamline their workflow and boost productivity."

**Why it's bad:** Overwhelming and unfocused. Tries to say everything and ends up saying nothing.

**What to do instead:** One clear benefit in 6-8 words. "Turn spreadsheets into web apps."

### Generic CTAs
**What it looks like:** "Get Started," "Learn More," "Sign Up," "Try Now" everywhere.

**Why it's bad:** Provides no specific motivation or context for the action.

**What to do instead:** Be specific about what happens next. "Build your first app" or "See pricing for your team size."

## Taste Test Checklist

Before finalizing any design, run through this quick checklist:

- [ ] **Would this design look at home on a 2019 Dribbble shot?** (If yes, it's probably too generic)
- [ ] **Does it have a purple gradient?** (Avoid unless specifically requested by brand)
- [ ] **Are there more than 2 fonts?** (Usually too many—simplify)
- [ ] **Does every section animate?** (Probably too much—be selective)
- [ ] **Could you swap the content for any other SaaS and it still work?** (Too generic—add personality)
- [ ] **Does the copy sound like every other tech company?** (Find your unique voice)
- [ ] **Are you using stock photos of people pointing at screens?** (Find more authentic imagery)
- [ ] **Is there a clear visual hierarchy?** (Users should know where to look first)
- [ ] **Would your grandmother understand what you do from this design?** (Test for clarity)
- [ ] **Does it feel human and intentional rather than algorithmic?** (The ultimate test)
